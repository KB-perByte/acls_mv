FIRST USECASE ---------- :) 

Blank device config 

populate data by config module

ansible-playbook playbooks/init.yaml -vvvv 

brownfild device is ready 
Gather the facts from the above configured brwnfield device
update inventory with other clear slate device

ansible-playbook playbooks/facts.yaml -vvvv

show in the clear slate device that the device is not having any config on the existing box

ssh ansible@10.0.150.103       <- brownfield 
ssh ansible@10.0.150.231       <- clearslate
show access-lists

checked on the clear slate device that there is no configuration present int the clear slate device
So, now we are trying to push the gahered config from the brownfield device and pushing it on to the clear slate device
using ansible Resource module, state - overriden

show the playbook for sure

ansible-playbook playbooks/configure.yaml -vvvv

the output of the play would be yellow and green,
so it changed for the clear slate device and did not change any config for the existing brownfield device

SECOND USECASE ----------- :) 

showing configuration drift and rescue, 


use make drift to change config on one of the boxes
ansible-playbook playbooks/make_drift.yaml

check drift by validating 
ansible-playbook playbooks/validate.yaml -vvvv

#TODO
1. interfaces implementation for iosxr_acl
2. update validate playbook with gathered state and assert the changes to show drift
